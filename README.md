This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). 
It employs:
1)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing class distribution, word counts, and common words in spam messages.
2)Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical features.
3)Modeling: A custom neural network implemented with PyTorch.

The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection dataset. It contains labeled SMS messages as spam or ham. 

The model gives 98.1624% accuracy in detecting spam messages
